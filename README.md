# Education-Attainment-in-UK
This repository contains an analysis of how growing up in a small town versus a large city influences educational success. The study explores the relationship between students' educational attainmentâ€”measured by high school and college graduation ratesâ€”and the demographics of their hometowns.

The investigation was inspired by findings from the UKâ€™s Office for National Statistics (ONS), which suggest that smaller towns may foster better academic outcomes. The dataset used in this study is derived from the Longitudinal Education Outcomes (LEO) database, containing anonymized information on students who completed their GCSEs in the 2012-2013 academic year. Ethical considerations were strictly followed to ensure privacy protection.

Key Research Areas
The impact of town size on high school and college graduation rates.
The influence of income and demographic factors on educational outcomes.
Statistical hypothesis testing to evaluate differences in graduation rates.
This repository includes data preprocessing scripts, statistical analysis, and visualization outputs used to assess the impact of hometown demographics on student success.
